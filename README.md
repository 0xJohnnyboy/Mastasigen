Mastasigen! is a markdown static blog generator. It lets you generate and update a blog from markdown articles.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You have 2 solutions to configure your blog to build:
- you can use CLI (Command Line Interface), in a simple or advanced mode.
- you can use the ``config.yaml`` file.
    
Using the CLI, you just have to run the following command:
 
```bash
py mastasigen.py --verbose --interaction
```

After choosing the language, you will have to choose between ``simple`` and ``advanced`` modes.
This is up to you ! The config helper will override ```config.yaml``` settings with the fields that you filled. 

The ``config.yaml`` lets you fine tune your blog to generate !

```yaml
title: 'Mastasigen!' Here is the title of your blog.
lang: 'fr' Mastasigen! handles i18n for english, french, german, italian, and espa√±ol.
charset: 'utf-8'
theme: 'system' Default theme is system. Choices are 'system', 'light' and 'dark'

header_image: './assets/img/kian-lem.jpg' This one isn't required, its the background header image. 
                                          This is the path of the original file, the generator will copy it 
                                          into the output folder.

short_description: This is the short description for the <meta> info.

```

Once you're done with config.yaml, just put some markdown files to render and run the following command
```bash
py mastasigen.py
```

You can add `-v` or `--verbose` to make it verbose.

Next time, to update your blog, add the `-u` or `--update` argument. This will only update the excerpt tiles in index and render the new markdown files
